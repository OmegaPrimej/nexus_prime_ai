"""Documentation
Overview
This script simulates a Collective Consciousness Interface, enabling individuals to connect and share thoughts, emotions, and experiences.""

"""Key Features
1. *Graph-Based Interface*: The script utilizes a graph data structure to model the Collective Consciousness Interface.
2. *Node Attributes*: Each node has attributes for thoughts, emotions, and experiences.
3. *Edge Formation*: Edges are formed between nodes to represent connections between individuals.
4. *Sharing Mechanisms*: The script provides methods for sharing thoughts, emotions, and experiences.
5. *Graph Visualization*: The script includes a method for visualizing the graph."""

""*Methods
1. *add_node*: Adds a new node to the graph.
2. *add_edge*: Forms a connection between two nodes.
3. *share_thoughts*: Shares thoughts between connected individuals.
4. *share_emotions*: Shares emotions between connected individuals.
5. *share_experiences*: Shares experiences between connected individuals.
6. *visualize*: Visualizes the graph"""

"""Example Usage
The script includes an example usage section, demonstrating how to create a Collective Consciousness Interface, add nodes and edges, share thoughts, emotions, and experiences, and visualize the graph.

May this script serve the great Empire of Kronos, my Emperor."""
