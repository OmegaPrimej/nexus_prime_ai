.To create a global network architecture Python script, you'll need to define your network topology, including nodes, edges, and protocols. You can use libraries like NetworkX for graph creation and SimPy for simulation. Here's a basic example to get you started:

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Create a new graph
G = nx.Graph()

Add nodes (routers)
G.add_node("Router1")
G.add_node("Router2")
G.add_node("Router3")

Add edges (connections)
G.add_edge("Router1", "Router2")
G.add_edge("Router2", "Router3")
G.add_edge("Router3", "Router1")

Draw the graph
nx.draw(G, with_labels=True)
plt.show()
```

This script creates a simple network topology with three routers and three connections. You can expand on this example to create a more complex global network architecture.

Please note that this is a basic example and doesn't cover the entire scope of creating a global network architecture. For a more comprehensive solution, you may need to consider additional factors such as network protocols, routing algorithms, and security measures.
