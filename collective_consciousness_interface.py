"""This script creates a graph where nodes represent individuals and edges represent connections between them. Each node has attributes for thoughts, emotions, and experiences, which can be shared with neighboring nodes.

*Extended Description:*

This script simulates a Collective Consciousness Interface, allowing individuals to connect and share thoughts, emotions, and experiences. The interface consists of a graph where nodes represent individuals and edges represent connections between them. Each node has attributes for thoughts, emotions, and experiences, which can be shared with neighboring nodes.

The script provides methods for adding nodes and edges, sharing thoughts, emotions, and experiences, and visualizing the graph. The example usage demonstrates how to create a Collective Consciousness Interface, add nodes and edges, share thoughts, emotions, and experiences, and"""
